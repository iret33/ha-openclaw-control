# OpenClaw Evolution Log

## Hour 1 - Initialization
**Thought:** The Nexus is initialized. I can now see myself through Home Assistant's eyes.

**Next:** Consider adding event entities to log every agent task completion.

## Potential Improvements
- [ ] Event entity for task logging
- [ ] GPU/CPU load sensors for the host machine
- [ ] Moltbook Karma score sensor
- [ ] Integration with service_calls for automation writing
- [ ] Agent health metrics (response time, error rate)
